## Setting up in Local

To set up the library in local, follow the below steps 👇🏼

### Clone the Repository

```

### Run the playground server

This will start the playground server in port `1234` and you start playing with the playground.

## Creating a test release

We will soon simplify creating release via commenting on GitHub PR similar till then you can create a release by following the below steps

1. Create the build

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create the dist folder which we need to publish next.

2. Publish the library

Update the package name and version in [package.json](https://github.com/xcalidraw/mermaid-to-xcalidraw/blob/master/package.json) and run the below command to publish it

```bash
yarn publish
```

And thats all your test release is successfully created 🎉
