# Codebase

The Codebase is divided into 2 Sections

* [How Parser Works under the hood](/docs/@xcalidraw/mermaid-to-xcalidraw/codebase/parser) - If you are interested in understanding and deep diving into inner workings of the Parser, then make sure to checkout this section.

* [Adding a new diagram type](/docs/@xcalidraw/mermaid-to-xcalidraw/codebase/new-diagram-type) - If you want to help us make the mermaid to Xcalidraw Parser more powerful, you will find all information in this section to do so.
