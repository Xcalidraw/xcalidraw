import { convertToXcalidrawElements}  from "@xcalidraw/xcalidraw"

try {
  const { elements, files } = await parseMermaid(diagramDefinition, {
    fontSize: DEFAULT_FONT_SIZE,
  });
  // currently the elements returned from the parser are in a "skeleton" format
  // which we need to convert to fully qualified xcalidraw elements first
  const xcalidrawElements = convertToXcalidrawElements(elements);

  // Render elements and files on Xcalidraw
} catch (e) {
  // Error handling
}
```
