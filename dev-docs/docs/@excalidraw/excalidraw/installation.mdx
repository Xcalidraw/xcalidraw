### Self-hosting fonts

By default, Xcalidraw will try to download all the used fonts from the [CDN](https://esm.run/@xcalidraw/xcalidraw/dist/prod).

For self-hosting purposes, you'll have to copy the content of the folder `node_modules/@xcalidraw/xcalidraw/dist/prod/fonts` to the path where your assets should be served from (i.e. `public/` directory in your project). In that case, you should also set `window.XCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH` to the very same path, i.e. `/` in case it's in the root:

```js
window.XCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH = "/";
```

or, if you serve your assets from the root of your CDN, you would do:

```js
// Vanilla
<head>
    <script>
        window.XCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH = "https://my.cdn.com/assets/";
    </script>    
</head>
```

or, if you prefer the path to be dynamicly set based on the `location.origin`, you could do the following:

```jsx
// Next.js
<Script id="load-env-variables" strategy="beforeInteractive" >
    { `window["XCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH"] = location.origin;` } // or use just "/"!
</Script>
```

### Dimensions of Xcalidraw

Xcalidraw takes _100%_ of `width` and `height` of the containing block so make sure the container in which you render Xcalidraw has non zero dimensions.
